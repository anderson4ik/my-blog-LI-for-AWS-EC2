Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of \"de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum\" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.`\r\n        ]\r\n    },\r\n]\r\n\r\nexport default articles;","import React, { useState, useEffect } from \"react\";\r\n\r\nimport ArticlesList from \"../components/ArticlesList\";\r\nimport CommentsList from \"../components/CommentsList\";\r\nimport UpvotesSection from \"../components/UpvotesSection\";\r\nimport AddCommentForm from \"../components/AddCommentForm\";\r\nimport NotFoundPage from \"../pages/NotFoundPage\";\r\nimport articleContent from \"./article-content\";\r\n\r\nconst ArticlePage = ({ match }) => {\r\n  const name = match.params.name;\r\n  const article = articleContent.find((article) => article.name === name);\r\n\r\n  const [articleInfo, setArticleInfo] = useState({ upvotes: 0, comments: [] });\r\n\r\n  useEffect(() => {\r\n    const fetchData = async () => {\r\n      const result = await fetch(`/api/articles/${name}`);\r\n      // http://localhost:8000 - it we get from configuration of package.json, parameter \"proxy\"\r\n      const body = await result.json();\r\n      //console.log(body);\r\n      setArticleInfo(body);\r\n    };\r\n    fetchData();\r\n  }, [name]);\r\n\r\n  if (!article) {\r\n    return <NotFoundPage />;\r\n  }\r\n\r\n  const otherArticles = articleContent.filter(\r\n    (article) => article.name !== name\r\n  );\r\n\r\n  return (\r\n    <>\r\n      <h1>{article.title}</h1>\r\n      <UpvotesSection articleName={name} upvotes={articleInfo.upvotes} setArticleInfo={setArticleInfo} />\r\n      {article.content.map((paragraph, key) => {\r\n        return <p key={key}>{paragraph}</p>;\r\n      })}\r\n      <CommentsList comments={articleInfo.comments} />\r\n      <AddCommentForm articleName={name} setArticleInfo={setArticleInfo} />\r\n      <h3>Other Articles:</h3>\r\n      <ArticlesList articles={otherArticles} />\r\n    </>\r\n  );\r\n};\r\n\r\nexport default ArticlePage;\r\n","import React from 'react';\r\n\r\nimport articleContent from './article-content';\r\nimport ArticlesList from '../components/ArticlesList';\r\n\r\nconst ArticlesListPage = () => {\r\n    return (\r\n       <>\r\n          <h1>Articles</h1>   \r\n             <ArticlesList articles={articleContent} />\r\n       </>   \r\n    );\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default ArticlesListPage;","import React from 'react';\r\nimport { Link } from 'react-router-dom';\r\n\r\nconst NavBar = () => {\r\n    return (\r\n       <nav>\r\n           <ul>\r\n               <li>\r\n                   <Link to=\"/\"  className='navbar-anchor'>Home</Link>\r\n               </li>\r\n               <li>\r\n                   <Link to=\"/about\" className='navbar-anchor'>About</Link>\r\n               </li>\r\n               <li>\r\n                   <Link to=\"/articles-list\" className='navbar-anchor'>Articles</Link>\r\n               </li>\r\n           </ul>\r\n       </nav>\r\n    );\r\n\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default NavBar;","import React from 'react';\nimport { \n  BrowserRouter as Router, \n  Route,\n  Switch\n} from 'react-router-dom';\n\nimport HomePage from './pages/HomePage';\nimport AboutPage from './pages/AboutPage';\nimport ArticlePage from './pages/ArticlePage';\nimport ArticlesListPage from './pages/ArticlesListPage';\nimport PageNotFound from './pages/NotFoundPage';\nimport NavBar from './NavBar';\nimport './App.css';\n\nfunction App() {\n  return (\n    <Router>\n      <div className=\"App\">\n        <NavBar />\n        <div id='page-body'>\n          <Switch>\n            <Route path='/' component={HomePage} exact />\n            <Route path='/about' component={AboutPage} />\n            <Route path='/articles-list' component={ArticlesListPage} />\n            <Route path='/article/:name' component={ArticlePage} />\n            <Route component={PageNotFound} />\n          </Switch>\n        </div>\n      </div>\n    </Router>\n  );\n}\n\nexport default App;\n","const reportWebVitals = onPerfEntry => {\n  if (onPerfEntry && onPerfEntry instanceof Function) {\n    import('web-vitals').then(({ getCLS, getFID, getFCP, getLCP, getTTFB }) => {\n      getCLS(onPerfEntry);\n      getFID(onPerfEntry);\n      getFCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getLCP(onPerfEntry);\n      getTTFB(onPerfEntry);\n    });\n  }\n};\n\nexport default reportWebVitals;\n","import 'whatwg-fetch';
